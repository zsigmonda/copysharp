# CopySharp
CopySharp is a Microsoft .NET Roslyn platform based semantic source code comparation tool for plagiarism checking. This is an experimental project, thus it is not recommended to trust this code blindly.

If you are interested in the Roslyn platform, and you are ready to gain knowledge about it, check out https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn

To contribute to this project, you will need Visual Studio 2015. (Community edition is just fine, so you don't need to spend a single dime on it.)
